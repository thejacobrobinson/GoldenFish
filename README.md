Python game made with Pygame for programarcadegames.com course
I made this game as a final project for the free online college Python course.  
This was apart of my first programming course and language.
I decided not to spend time sprucing it up with animations and music (which was taught in
this course) b/c I preferred to eventually make this game for iOS.  After proving to myself
that I understood the basics I then started learning Swift.
